- :name: Donations and Grand Policy
  :content: "<h4>Introduction</h4>\r\n<p>Donations and grants enable WikiRate to undertake
    its vital work as a non-profit organization. WikiRate aims to secure a diverse
    funding mix to maintain its independence and operate effectively.</p>\r\n<h4>Background</h4>\r\n<p>WikiRate
    makes funding decisions according to the needs of its charitable programs and
    purposes, and consults the WikiRate core principles when deciding whether or not
    to accept funding:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Availability and usability of information.
    Information on corporations' social and environmental impacts should be abundant
    and usable;</li>\r\n<li>Diverse points of view on a neutral platform. Users, not
    WikiRate, judge companies; Users, not WikiRate, judge data quality; Editorial
    bias should be minimised;</li>\r\n<li>Open discussion and collaboration. Deliberation
    and discussion is visible; Collaborative projects are encouraged; and</li>\r\n<li>Openness
    and respect. All are welcome. Anyone can join WikiRate: individuals, advocacy
    groups, academics and researchers, company representatives, etc. Be honest and
    transparent, disclose conflicts of interest and address misrepresentations.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Any
    funding that compromises these principles will not be accepted.</p>\r\n<h4>Policy</h4>\r\n<p>WikiRate
    accepts funding, whether monetary or in-kind, provided that acceptance does not
    compromise WikiRate's independence to pursue its mission or endanger WikiRate's
    integrity. Contributions are used for the furtherance of WikiRate's charitable
    programs and purposes.</p>\r\n<h4>Scope</h4>\r\n<p>This Policy applies to all
    funding for WikiRate, regardless of types of donor or amounts involved, unless
    otherwise stated in this document. It is to be applied to all new funding from
    existing donors and to all new donors in the future. Appropriate care to protect
    the reputation of WikiRate should always be taken.</p>\r\n<h4>Guidelines</h4>\r\n<p>Funding
    to enable WikiRate to carry out its work should be sought from a wide range of
    sources, and for specific projects as well as general operations. Subject to maintaining
    WikiRate's independence and reputation, WikiRate will publicly disclose all corporate
    donations and grants with a value of more than Γé¼1,000. We commit to protecting
    the privacy of individual donors and will only disclose identifying details about
    these donors if we have their consent.</p>\r\n<p>Any donation to a WikiRate body
    must be able to stand up to public scrutiny. WikiRate will always publish company
    data in a free and impartial manner regardless of whether an entity has donated
    funds to the WikiRate Project.</p>\r\n<p>If there is a risk that receiving funds
    from a particular source would impair WikiRate's independence, if there is a risk
    to WikiRate's reputation from public association with the donor, or for any other
    reasons, WikiRate reserves the right to not accept the contribution. WikiRate
    also reserves the right to return funding if the integrity and/or intentions of
    the funding source are called into question after a donation has been received.
    The views of the WikiRate community will also be taken into consideration when
    deciding whether to accept or return a donation.</p>\r\n<p>WikiRate can receive
    funding from corporations and donors from the private sector. This does not imply
    any endorsement of a donating company's policies or record. WikiRate may request
    that donors sign a memorandum of understanding before any donation is accepted.</p>\r\n<p>This
    policy will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:
    right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bolder; font-size: 15.2px;\">Policy last updated:</span><span
